                Step into the realm of 'The Striped Sovereign', a stunningly
                detailed portrayal of the majestic zebra. With commanding
                presence, it symbolizes power and authority in its savanna
                kingdom. Every stroke captures its regal aura and the resilience
                of the wild, all in striking black and white, immortalizing
                nature's beauty in monochrome. In the wild and on paper.

                "Regal Gaze" is a portrait inspired by a photo taken from a
                helicopter in Kenya. It distinguishes itself in my collection as
                the sole piece not related to Longleat. During my time in Kenya,
                I had the privilege of spending time with the Sheldrick Trust
                team, renowned figures in the wildlife conservation field. As
                part of the Aerial Surveillance Unit, they operate fixed-wing
                aircraft and helicopters, covering extensive distances on patrol
                every month. This particular shot was taken during one of their
                patrols in late 2023.

                For my collection, I sought to portray a less conventional
                animal in a nuanced light. The rhino portrait is a captivating
                fraction of a larger photographed image taken on my vist to
                Longleat. The photo featuring three rhinos head to head. Unlike
                the others, this piece invites you to pause and ponder. It's not
                just admiration; it's a puzzle to piece together and a maze to
                navigate, offering endless discoveries with each glance.

                In April 2011, Anne was rescued from a life of captivity in a
                circus and found sanctuary at Longleat, where she could finally
                embrace the peace and dignity she deserved. Her eyes, bearing
                witness to years of hardship and fleeting moments of joy,
                captivate with their intensity, leaving an enduring impression
                of resilience and strength. Anne transcends her identity as an
                elephant; she embodies a beacon of hope and freedom.

                The cheetah's allure lies in its unique fur pattern, with each
                spot as distinct as a fingerprint. In this piece, I departed
                from my usual focus on capturing facial features, apprehensive
                that I might lose my knack for bringing faces to life. Instead,
                I discovered a new appreciation for the cheetah's design. No two
                spots were alike in depth, shape, or size, revealing the
                intricacies of nature's artistry.

                My art appeals to a wide audience, offering both depth of
                thought and simple joy. While some pieces delve into complex
                emotions, others, like this adorable monkey portrait, are simply
                uplifting.
                <br /><br />
                With their innocence, playfulness, and mischievous nature, baby
                monkeys create a heartwarming contrast to the impactful and
                intense monochrome pieces in my collection. As I curated this
                series, I aimed to evoke a range of emotions, and the addition
                of a baby monkey piece serves as an emotional interlude,
                providing a moment of tenderness amidst the depth of the others.

          Pahrnia has been nurturing her passion for over fifteen years, crafting her talent into a skill she carries with her across the globe.
          <br /><br />
          During her early twenties, she developed a strong appetite for exploration and started traveling around the world, often giving her art away to individuals she stayed with as a token of appreciation. It was much later when she realized her creative tendencies could be turned into a profession.
          <br /><br />
          "It's a skill I'm grateful to possess, one that has allowed me to connect with people on a profound level and give something meaningful in return," she reflects.
          <br /><br />
          Drawing initially served as a means of both passing time and creatively procrastinating from her formal studies.
          <br /><br />
          The positive responses to her early portraits spurred her to delve deeper into her artistry. As her skills evolved, she found herself venturing into unexpected and diverse projects, from selling prints of celebrity portraits on the streets of Auckland when she was a backpacker to invitations to Kenya to draw the Maasai Tribe.
          <br /><br />
          Pahrnia is a portrait artist whose pieces aim to elicit emotion or to educate and inspire. She creates content that details the trajectory of the piece, from the initial brainstorming phase to the finishing touches of the pen stroke. Adopting hyperrealism with a biro, her objective is to capture the subject’s personality.
          <br /><br />
          "For me, drawing is akin to meditation or yoga. It's a moment of complete presence, where my mind is wholly engaged in the creative process," she explains.
          <br /><br />
          Curating this current collection has been a passion project devised in October 2022, when a series of unfortunate events cut her global travels short and led her to revisit her hometown. This collection, in collaboration with Longleat Safari Park, eventually begun in Summer 2023 where a photographer and she were provided a VIP tour of the Park to capture photos of the amazing animals there, which she has been busy recreating in Biro pen in the months since.
          <br /><br />
          The culmination of this project in her hometown feels like a poetic convergence of her artistry and her roots. Encapsulating the essence of her exhibition, this has become Art at the Heart… of Bath for Pahrnia.
